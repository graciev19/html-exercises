# 2-favorite-things

In this exercise, write a complete HTML page using elements discussed in the lecture, as well as from the readings.

Make the page about your favorite things! Don't worry about images yet, unless you understand how to implement them properly.

## Project Folder Setup

Within the root of this folder, `2-fave-things`, create the following within VSC like we practiced during class:

- A new folder with your lastname
- Inside this folder, create a new `index.html` file.

## Basic Webpage setup

Don't forget the basics: 

- `doctype`
- `html`
- `head`
  - Nested within the `head`, reference and use the following tags: `meta` and `title`
- `body`

## `BLOCK` elements

Practice structuring your page by using the following `BLOCK` elements:

- `header`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`
- Meaningful heading tags and levels (& headings too!)
- Common content block elements: 
  - paragraphs `p`
  - lists, such as `ul` or `ol` with nested list items (`li`)


## `INLINE` elements

Practice wrapping inline text in your page by using the following `INLINE` elements:

- Use anchor tags `a` that link to other pages or parts of pages
  - `a` elements require the use of some *attributes*. Be sure to look them up.
- Use `strong` to wrap text that you wish to make more bold, 
- Use `em` where you want text to be emphasized via italics

## Devilish Details of Syntax

- Opening and closing tags 
- Representing what level an element is in the tree hierarchy
- Recall how you will represent hierarchy through your indentation scheme, and how we all set our code editors to use a *2-space indentation* rule. Here's a basic example below to help you remember:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Example indentation</h1>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Tips and Suggestions

Please commit and push your code as you progress to our repo. That means, if you finish a section, or need to pause your work, save it, commit it, and push it to Github. That way, your work is saved in 2 locations too!
