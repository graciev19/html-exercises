      <h2>Reading & Writing</h2>
      <p>
        I have so many books that are on my list to read, but I keep growing it anyway. I can't resist it;
        if a book sounds good, I can't help but buy it. I love getting lost in a story or learning about 
        a random topic I've selected. Often, I gravitate toward the fantasy genre in both reading <em>and</em>
        writing. I want to be a novelist one day, and I hope to write fantasy stories. But I don't always read
        fantasy books. I also quite enjoy detective fiction. In particular, Agatha Christie. I think her books
        are fantastic.

        Anyway, I think you get the picture. I like reading and writing <strong>a lot.</strong> I'll move off
        the subject for now.
