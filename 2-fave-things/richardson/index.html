      <h2>Reading & Writing</h2>
      <p>
        I have so many books that are on my list to read, but I keep growing it anyway. I can't resist it;
        if a book sounds good, I can't help but buy it. I love getting lost in a story or learning about 
        a random topic I've selected. Often, I gravitate toward the fantasy genre in both reading <em>and</em>
        writing. I want to be a novelist one day, and I hope to write fantasy stories. But I don't always read
        fantasy books. I also quite enjoy detective fiction. In particular, Agatha Christie. I think her books
        are fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I think you get the picture. I like reading and writing <strong>a lot.</strong> I'll move off
        the subject for now.

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>
        I bought myself a Nintendo Switch last fall and have loved it ever since. I've been collecting games,
        whether I buy them myself or they're gifted to me for Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>These are the games that I currently own, in order of when I got them:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mariokart 8</li>
        <li>Yoshi's Crafted World</li>
        <li>Pokemon: Shield</li>
        <li>Super Mario Party</li>
        <li>Animal Crossing</li>
        <li>Lego: The Incredibles</li>
        <li>Hades</li>
        <li>Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu</li>
        <li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
      </ol>
      <p>But which are my favorites? I'll give you my top three. In no particular order, of course. I
        don't know how I'd make that determination.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Super Mario Party</li>
        <li>Hades</li>
        <li>One of the Pokemon games, though I'm not sure which yet. I haven't really gotten into one yet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A Mario game had to make the list for me. Mario games are a huge part of my childhood; my brother and I grew up playing them,
        and I have particularly good memories of playing a lot of different iterations of Mario Party, so this Switch version naturally 
        makes it into the top three.</p>
      <p>While I may have grown up playing Mario games and <em>not</em> playing any Pokemon games, I have branched out a bit since purchasing 
        my own system, and I've really grown to love them. I'm still very new to them, so I'm still learning, but the style places them in the top three as well.</p>
      <p>Hades is just a really fun, very well designed game. The art style is incredible, and the story is fascinating. Usually I get bored of games
        that are super repetitive (which this is; you go out and fight through the Underworld in a very similar manner each run), there is enough
        variety and enough story to keep me interesting and to continue coming back.
