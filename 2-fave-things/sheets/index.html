            <p>One of my favorite things in life is making lists. Even if they're super unnecessary ones like 'Favorite Caffeinated Liquids', lists just bring order and comfort to my life. So, without further ado, please enjoy five lists of my favorite things. (Including Favorite Caffeinated Liquids).</p>

            <h3><em>Tangled</em> (2010) dir. Bryan Howard, Nathan Greno</h3>

                <li>As far as animated films go, this is by far my favorite of all time. I love the storybook color grading and the use of purples and yellows.
                    It shows a really honest depiction of a codependent parent-child relationship. Mother Gothel and Rapunzel depend on each other, but the love
                    between them is one-sided. Among other things, you can't beat the soundtrack. And that hair animation! You just can't believe it's from 2010.

            <h3><em>Mamma Mia!</em> (2008) dir. Phyllida Lloyd</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>My mom regrets showing me this film at age seven. But honestly, what seven year old is thinking about Donna, who has three guesses at who her daughter's 
                    father is? No, I was thinking about how cool it would be to live on an island with a built-in Greek (literally) chorus. Whoever decided to turn ABBA's music
                    into a musical, and then decided it should be a movie, and then decided to cast Meryl Streep as Donna, is a crazy genius. This film is colorful, full of
                    heart and humor, and a cult classic you'll want to watch every year to kick off your summer.
