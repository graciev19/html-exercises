            <p>One of my favorite things in life is making lists. Even if they're super unnecessary ones like 'Favorite Caffeinated Liquids', lists just bring order and comfort to my life. So, without further ado, please enjoy four lists of my favorite things. (Including Favorite Caffeinated Liquids).</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Movies*</h2>
                <p><em>*In no particular order</em></p>
            </header>
            
            <h3><em>Tangled</em> (2010) dir. Bryan Howard, Nathan Greno</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/10vZ5EnSX4R8nm" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/disney-tangled-weekend-rapunzel-10vZ5EnSX4R8nm">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As far as animated films go, this is by far my favorite of all time. I love the storybook color grading and the use of purples and yellows.
                    It shows a really honest depiction of a codependent parent-child relationship. Mother Gothel and Rapunzel depend on each other, but the love
                    between them is one-sided. Among other things, you can't beat the soundtrack. And that hair animation! You just can't believe it's from 2010.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Mamma Mia!</em> (2008) dir. Phyllida Lloyd</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/BsLWokF6nBg79oSQ3a" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tiff-dancing-abba-mamma-mia-BsLWokF6nBg79oSQ3a">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>My mom regrets showing me this film at age seven. But honestly, what seven year old is thinking about Donna, who has three guesses at who her daughter's 
                    father is? No, I was thinking about how cool it would be to live on an island with a built-in Greek (literally) chorus. Whoever decided to turn ABBA's music
                    into a musical, and then decided it should be a movie, and then decided to cast Meryl Streep as Donna, is a crazy genius. This film is colorful, full of
                    heart and humor, and a cult classic you'll want to watch every year to kick off your summer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em> (1986) dir. John Hughes</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/V526T6UMjXx0A" width="480" height="274" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ferris-buellers-day-off-bueller-V526T6UMjXx0A">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You just can't go wrong with Mr. Hughes. I first watched this film in my AP Psychology class, junior year of high school. It was that time after tests were
                    done, and there was no reason why we should be at school. Everyone was a little giddy. I sat there, watching, as this movie changed the course of my life irrevocably.
                    (Side note: I am literally Cameron. So much Cameron.) This movie is bright and boisterous and a tribute to the era in which it was made. I just love it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>The Parent Trap</em> (1998) dir. Nancy Meyers</h3></h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7TKVMCEqBl9Gjwk0" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nickatnite-lindsay-lohan-parent-trap-3o7TKVMCEqBl9Gjwk0">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This has been a long-time favorite. Watching this as a kid, there was just something magical about the idea of going away to a summer camp for the 
                    entire summer. There was something so alluring about Hallie and Annie's mom's life in London, designing wedding dresses. There was something so exciting about
                    switiching places with a long lost twin. The cast of characters in this one is so beautifully done, you can't help but root for them all, even wily Meredith Blake.
                    A reall feel-good classic.

                <h2>My Favorite Music Artists</h2>
                <p><em>Note: this is based on my Spotify Wrapped feature of 2021</em></p>
                <p>I've included my favorite song by each artist.</p>
            </header>

            <ol>
                <li><h3><em>Taylor Swift</em></h3></li>
                <p>It should be noted that, for the most part, I listen to a large amount of music artists, just a couple of songs from each one. Therefore, when there is an artist
                    that I enjoy most of their music, they usually make it into my Spotify Wrapped top artists. This is especially the case for Taylor Swift. Rarely do I consistently
                    listen to an artists entire discography, but Ms. Swift is just that good. I think lyricism is her strong suit, and as a poet, I love dissecting her language.
                    She's artist of the decade for a reason. Her ability to span genres and consistently gain notoriety is something to be admired.
                </p>
                <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1XjHRolIXL2M1EEOUsGGR4?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

                <li><h3><em>One Direction</em></h3></li>
                <p>You might be surprised to hear that I wasn't a One Direction fan until after the band parted ways in 2015. As a child, during their rise to fame, I was staunchly
                    against liking something so popular, but it's only now that I lament my immaturity. One Direction was a phenomenon for more than their looks; their music is pop-rock 
                    on drugs. It's so addicting to listen to, and you just can't not dance to it. Props to whoever wrote their music. Listening to them reminds me of a simpler era
                    in my life, and it's the nostalgia that keeps this band in my top artists every single year.
                </p>

                <li><h3><em>MARINA</em></h3></li>
                <p>This was a new one for me! I knew of MARINA for quite some time,but never fully delved into her music. However, during the summer of 2021, one of her older songs went
                    viral on TikTok, which spurred some of her other music to become popualr on the app, too. This is how I began listening to her. She's a relic of the circa-2013-Tumblr-
                    grunge-bubblegum-pop, and boy is she catchy. Her music has a very distinct sound, and listening to it is akin to someone putting tiny fireworks in your ears. I had
                    an intense period of listening to the same four or five songs by her on my drive to work every day in the summer of 2021.
                </p>
                <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/41P2Wi4vVI8hXxz5St5a4J?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

                <li><h3><em>Phoebe Bridgers</em></h3></li>
                <p>Phoebe Bridgers is the queen of the newfound "sad girl" genre. Her music is willowy, soft-spoken, and understated, and her lyrics, like Taylor Swift, are genius. It's
                    no wonder Swift invited Bridgers to feature in a song on Swift's recent <em>Red (Taylor's Version)</em> album release. However, I'd say that Phoebe's lyrics are a little 
                    more in-your-face, but not in a bad way. She says exactly what you're thinking, before you even knew you were thinking it. Start with the <em>Punisher</em> album 
                    and work your way backwards.
                </p>

                <h2>My Favorite Video Games</h2>
            </header>

            <h3><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> (2020)</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/h8ISB2nUVITEWjVgGo" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-h8ISB2nUVITEWjVgGo">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They say you can't beat the classics, but I have to say this comes pretty dang close. Animal Crossing fans, including myself, waited a long time for a new AC game 
                    to be released, and boy did Nintendo deliver. People have a lot to say about this game, even going on two years since the release, but if you've played it slow like
                    I have, it's such a good experience. I wouldn't ask for much more from this game. As a long-time AC fan, it's pretty close to perfect.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> (2014)</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/13NKbbVWMt6nFm" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mario-kart-8-13NKbbVWMt6nFm">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some people say Mario Kart is the type of game you only play every once in a while, and only with a group of friends. However, those people don't understand what it
                    was like to live in a residential hall during the 2020-2021 school year. Classes were online, so I spent two whole semesters in a small suite-style dorm area. What were 
                    my friends and I to do to keep our sanity? Get insanely good at Mario Kart. I spent my time getting the gold in every CC, and battling hard COM with my friends.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Animal Crossing: Wild World</em> (2005)</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3PXsZ3nuzgAOA" width="480" height="369" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/video-games-animal-crossing-nds-3PXsZ3nuzgAOA">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Way back in the day, my brother and I both got this game for Christmas. I had grown up watching my brother play video games, but never really played anything myself 
                    beyond Nintendogs. I didn't know much about gaming, but I loved this game so much. I was discovering some of the easter eggs in the game without even trying. Nowadays
                    I have to look up easter eggs on google! But I didn't have resources like that. I was just playing for fun. You can't beat nostalgia. This game's the ultimate comfort game.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>The Sims 4</em> (2014)</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/EP6nu6RXRWAkU" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nicki-minaj-the-sims-gif-EP6nu6RXRWAkU">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the past few years, I've played this game entirely on my friend's Origin account. She's an only child and has jsut about every expansion pack ever released for this game, 
                    so it's like living the ultimate life of Sims luxury. I started playing on my old Macbook Air, probably ruining it in the process, and eventually moved up to my brother's old 
                    PC gaming system when he built a new one. This one I have to be careful with, because if I get sucked in, I waste my days away playing. But, in small doses, it's so fun.
