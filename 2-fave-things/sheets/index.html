            <p>One of my favorite things in life is making lists. Even if they're super unnecessary ones like 'Favorite Caffeinated Liquids', lists just bring order and comfort to my life. So, without further ado, please enjoy five lists of my favorite things. (Including Favorite Caffeinated Liquids).</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Movies</h2>
            </header>
            
            <h3><em>Tangled</em> (2010) dir. Bryan Howard, Nathan Greno</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/10vZ5EnSX4R8nm" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/disney-tangled-weekend-rapunzel-10vZ5EnSX4R8nm">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As far as animated films go, this is by far my favorite of all time. I love the storybook color grading and the use of purples and yellows.
                    It shows a really honest depiction of a codependent parent-child relationship. Mother Gothel and Rapunzel depend on each other, but the love
                    between them is one-sided. Among other things, you can't beat the soundtrack. And that hair animation! You just can't believe it's from 2010.

            </ul>

            <h3><em>Mamma Mia!</em> (2008) dir. Phyllida Lloyd</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/BsLWokF6nBg79oSQ3a" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tiff-dancing-abba-mamma-mia-BsLWokF6nBg79oSQ3a">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>My mom regrets showing me this film at age seven. But honestly, what seven year old is thinking about Donna, who has three guesses at who her daughter's 
                    father is? No, I was thinking about how cool it would be to live on an island with a built-in Greek (literally) chorus. Whoever decided to turn ABBA's music
                    into a musical, and then decided it should be a movie, and then decided to cast Meryl Streep as Donna, is a crazy genius. This film is colorful, full of
                    heart and humor, and a cult classic you'll want to watch every year to kick off your summer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em> (1986) dir. John Hughes</h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/V526T6UMjXx0A" width="480" height="274" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ferris-buellers-day-off-bueller-V526T6UMjXx0A">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You just can't go wrong with Mr. Hughes. I first watched this film in my AP Psychology class, junior year of high school. It was that time after tests were
                    done, and there was no reason why we should be at school. Everyone was a little giddy. I sat there, watching, as this movie changed the course of my life irrevocably.
                    (Side note: I am literally Cameron. So much Cameron.) This movie is bright and boisterous and a tribute to the era in which it was made. I just love it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><em>The Parent Trap</em> (1998) dir. Nancy Meyers</h3></h3>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7TKVMCEqBl9Gjwk0" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nickatnite-lindsay-lohan-parent-trap-3o7TKVMCEqBl9Gjwk0">via GIPHY</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This has been a long-time favorite. Watching this as a kid, there was just something magical about the idea of going away to a summer camp for the 
                    entire summer. There was something so alluring about Hallie and Annie's mom's life in London, designing wedding dresses. There was something so exciting about
                    switiching places with a long lost twin. The cast of characters in this one is so beautifully done, you can't help but root for them all, even wily Meredith Blake.
                    A reall feel-good classic.
