      <h2>Sports</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Probably my biggest passion in my life is sports. I know it sounds pretty basic and lame, 
      but sports are just something that I've always just enjoyed playing and watching. My Favorite
      sports are college football and college basketball, mainly because I feel like each of those
      have unmatched competiveness compared to other types of sports.

      <h2>Writing</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I've always been really into writing ever since I was a little kid. Over time I started to combine
      my writing with the sports I watch and eventually I just started writing about sports exclusively. Now 
     I cover a couple different Virginia Tech sports on beats and I write about some of my favorite professional 
     teams for fun.

     <h2>My Dog</h2>
   </header>
   <P>My dog is one of my favorite things on the planet. His name is Murphy and he's a yellow english lab.
     He's almost three feet tall and around a hundred pounds, so he's a pretty big guy. He's about a year and a half 
     old so my family got him pretty recently. I never had a dog when I was younger, so I really enjoy being able to spend
     time with my dog when I go home for breaks.
