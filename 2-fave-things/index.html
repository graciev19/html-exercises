      <h1>Introduction Series 1: Get to Know Me!</h1>
      <p> Welcome to the first of my series, where for the next few weeks I will be publishing my written work and will be using this space to conversate with you all about social and general news, entertainment, and more! My name is Christeana Williams, and I am a junior at Virginia Tech studying Multimedia Journalism and minoring in Professional and Technical Writing. I am so glad you are here and hope you report back every Monday to hear what's new. To kick off this series, here are two things you should know about me!</p>

        <h2> Number 1: I Am a Sucker for Quality Time!</h2>
        <p>Whether I am with family or friends, and have the time to hang out, count me in! I am an extroverted person and any chance I get to spend time with my loved ones, it is a must. No, it doesnt mean I can't be alone, like my twin sister would say. It just means that I love people because I get to listen, laugh, and bond with them and find what their interests are. Here are a few things I enjoy doing with people...</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Grabbing lunch or dinner with someone</li>
          <li>Going on a hike along the mountains: This is still son my bucket list, so I'll count it. If you are in the NOVA area, let me know and we can link!</li>
          <li>Having movie nights: I am a huge fan of Marval and Disney movies.</li>
          <li>Game Nights</li>
          <li>Going to church and spending the day with my members: Shout out to the World Mission Society Church of God!</li>
          <li>Spending time with my bestfriend, Christe a.k.a my twin sister</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong>It is honeslty never a dull moment with your friends and family. I highly suggest that if you are feeling alone and want to get out, I am sure that there is always someone willing to be there, and together get to do all the amazing things you have planned.</p>

      <h2>Number 2: Where Are My Volleyball Fans At?</h2>
      <p>I am a huge fan of volleyball and played for 4 years. I started when I was in 8th grade after my sister told me how fun it was. At first, I only joined it because my mom told me it was great exercise. So, I added it to the million of other things I did in high school. Yes, I was that girl. But I fell in love with it until I tore my ACL at a game right before my senior night. So I did not play, which is what EVERYONE looks foward to! Did I mention I was captian of the varisty team? So, heres a list of what I had to do instead. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fetch water for the team</li>
        <li>Cheer them on as I casually cried inside</li>
        <li>Give them pep talks </li>
        <li>Keep their seats warm</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are so many things that I wish I had done to prevent the injury from happening but I do give credit to that experience because I wouldn't have found my love for journalism if I hadn't made volleyball the center of my life.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Shoot for the stars but be sure that you have a back of plan just in case things don't turn out the way you want them to be. If you think otherwise, let's talk about it.</p>
