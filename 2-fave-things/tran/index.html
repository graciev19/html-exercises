      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along would be the last thing in
        people's minds. After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears
        meek and distant to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their
        hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her
        friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body
        bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.
        Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often
        spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a
        side of themselves concealed from the outside world.
