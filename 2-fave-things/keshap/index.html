            <h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>
        </header>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Omelettes</h3>
                <p>I have always loved cooking. One of the first things I learned how to make was an omelette. I have curated my skill over the year, and have managed to come up with a method that creates the best omelette ever. Last semester, I made a video on my omelette making process in order to share the wealth of deliciousness.</p>

                <h3>Pasta</h3>
                <p>My favorite kind of pasta is chicken and broccoli alfredo. Unfortunately, I recently had to go on a gluten free diet. I've had to adjust to leaving my favorite foods behind. Luckily, my friends and family have helped me find the best substitutes so I can still enjoy my favorite foods, such as pasta. I have found out that the <a href="https://www.barilla.com/en-us/product-results/pasta/range/gluten-free?sort=alpha&page=1" target="_blank">Barilla Gluten Free pasta</a> is the best substitute when it comes to still wanting that authentic taste.</p>

                <h3>Fruit</h3>
                <p>I know fruit is pretty vague in terms of it being a favorite food. I love a ton of different kinds of fruit. I used to live on a tropical island, so fresh fruit was always something I had in my diet. I miss being able to go outside and pick mangoes off the trees. I feel like it is hard to get good fruit from the grocery store, but when it comes straight off of the tree, fruit is one of my favorite foods.</p>

                <h3>Hiking Sigiriya Rock</h3>
                <p>When I lived in Sri Lanka, my family went on a hike to this old fort on a huge rock. I am deathly afraid of heights, and was shaking the entire way up. When I finally made it to the top, The view was so incredible and eased all of my nerves. It was definitely worth all of the fear in order to experience something that beautiful. I would love to be able to go back one day and experience it again.</p>

                <h3>Din Tai Fung</h3>
                <p>Din Tai Fung is an incredible restaurant that has only a few locations around the world. They have these amazing Xaio Long Bao which is pork soup dumplings. My family used to take weekend trips to Singapore in order to go shopping and do various errands such as visit the doctor, and we would always end our trip with dinner at Din Tai Fung. I love it so much that I've emailed them multiple times begging for them to open up a restaurant on the East Coast. If you ever find yourself in the same city as a Din Tai Fung, make sure you go! Check out their locations <a href="https://www.dintaifungusa.com/us/locations.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Deciding to come to Virginia Tech</h3>
                <p>Both of my parents went to UVA (<strong>yuck</strong>) and so I grew up hating Virginia Tech. When I was applying to colleges, my mom convinced me to come visit, just to keep my options open. It ended up being the best college visit, and I instantly fell in love. To this day, I cannot imagine what my life would be like if I had ended up at another school. Gokies!</p>
