      <h2>Basketball</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Watching basketball is without a doubt my favorite pastime. My favorite team in the NBA is the Dallas Mavericks. 
      They are currently fifth in the Western Conference, but are just a game or two outside of first place. I honestly 
      have no idea what made me start liking the Mavericks, I'm from a small town in Southwest Virginia. This team just 
      caught my eye and the rest is history. I want to make a career as a sports writer that covers the NBA.

      <h2>Dogs</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Dogs never fail to make me smile. I have one dog back in my hometown that I share with my siblings. Her name is Piper
      and she is a redbone coonhound. She is practically a small pony. I have two dogs with my roommates here in Blacksburg.
      The first one is a Husky/Border Collie mix and her name is Bear, and the other one is some sort of lab-mix puppy named Abu
      that was left at my roommate's house back home. Dogs give me a sense of comfort and joy and never make me feel like I am alone. 
      They each have their own little personalities and I love being able to give them a happy life.

     <h3>Painting</h3>
   </header>
   <p>I love to paint. It has always been something that has been a fun, stress relieving activity of mine. I like to paint things such
     as cartoon characters and nature landscapes. There is something so calming about being able to sit down and pour your heart and mind 
     into a canvas and to be able to produce something that you can call your own.
