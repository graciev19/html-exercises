<section id="Introduction">
  <p>Everybody has their favorites. Favorite movies, TV shows, ice cream, 
    comic book superhero, books, etcs. Here's some fun facts about 
    <em>my</em> favorite things.

    <h2>Favorite Video Games</h2>
    </header>
    <ul>
<li><h3>Pokemon</h3>
<p>I've been in love with these games for as long as I can remember. Though
  the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank">new games</a> have their flaws 
  (being too easy, having questionable new designs, not enough <em>banging</em> music,) 
  I love the series too much to complain. You get to collect a bunch of animal friends 
  and make them fight each other. What more could you want? 
</p>

</li>

 <li><h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
 <p>This is a game I recommend to everyone regardless of previous gaming experience. 
   You could have 10,000 hours on GTA or have never touched a console since your Nintendo 
   DS and I would still recommend trying <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley.</a> 
   There's combat with underground monsters, romancing options, and, most importantly, a fishing mini game.

</li>
  <li><h3>Hades</h3>
  <p>This <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/" target= "_blank">dungeon crawler</a> is the first I've ever gotten emotionally invested in. 
    The art style is incredible, the action is brilliantly placed, and the story is engaging. You can skip the scenes of dialogue and 
    just mash through undead enemies or learn about the tragic backstories of the Ancient Greek gods and goddesses. 
    If you read Percy Jackson as a kid, I think it's safe to say you'd like this game.

  <h2>Favorite Disney Movies</h2>
</header>
  <ul>
  <li><h3><em>Tangled</em></h3></li>
<p>This is easily my favorite Disney movie. It has everything that I want in a Disney movie: 
  catchy songs, an endearing magical princess, and a handsome prince that actually has a personality. 
  It's easily better than <em>Frozen</em> and I will die on that hill if need be. 
</p>

style="width: 450px; height: 280px; margin: 0px;">

  <li><h3><em>The Lion King</em></h3></li>
<p>No, not the weird, emotionless 2019 live action remake. Without watching this movie as a kid, I don't think 
  I would have the same love for Disney movies that I do now. The animation is still spectacular to watch, 
the drama is incredibly mature for a children's movie, 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08-uyfp2iPM" target="_blank">"Be Prepared"</a> might be my favorite song in all of Disney. Yes, it's a cat version of <em>Hamlet,</em>
 but it's still a Disney classic.

style="width: 450px; height: 280px; margin: 0px;">

  <li><h3><em>Mulan</em></h3></li>
<p>Once again, Disney tried to create a cash-grab remake with a movie that was perfect as is. Though the songs 
  are more sparse than your typical Disney film, they all blend with the story beautifully. Both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9MfuWSQoWc" target="_blank">"I'll Make a Man Out of You"</a> 
  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_BtlAw4trg" target="_blank">"Reflection"</a> still give me chills after my umpteenth rewatch. Like <em>The Lion King,</em> it tackles some pretty 
  adult themes for a children's movie, including sexism, grief, and war.
