  <p>Everybody has their favorites. Favorite movies, TV shows, ice cream, 
    comic book superhero, books, etcs. Here's some fun facts about 
    <em>my</em> favorite things.

    <h2>Video Games</h2>

    <ul>
<li><strong>Pokemon</strong></li>
<p>I've been in love with these games for as long as I can remember. Though
  the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank">new games</a> have their flaws 
  (being too easy, having questionable new designs, not enough <em>banging</em> music,) 
  I love the series too much to complain. You get to collect a bunch of animal friends 
  and make them fight each other. What more could you want?

 <li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>
 <p>This is a game I recommend to everyone regardless of previous gaming experience. 
   You could have 10,000 hours on GTA or have never touched a console since your Nintendo 
   DS and I would still recommend trying <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley.</a> 
   There's combat with underground monsters, romancing options, and, most importantly, a fishing mini game.

  style="width: 450px; height: 280px; margin: 0px;">
  <li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
  <p>This <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/" target= "_blank">dungeon crawler</a> is the first I've ever gotten emotionally invested in. 
    The art style is incredible, the action is brilliantly placed, and the story is engaging. You can skip the scenes of dialogue and 
    just mash through undead enemies or learn about the tragic backstories of the Ancient Greek gods and goddesses. 
    If you read Percy Jackson as a kid, I think it's safe to say you'd like this game.
