    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <ul>
<li><strong>Pokemon</strong></li>
<p>I've been in love with these games for as long as I can remember. Though
  the new games have their flaws (ex, being too easy, having questionable new designs, 
  not enough <em>banging</em> music,), I love the series too much to complain. You get 
  to collect a bunch of animal friends and make them fight each other. What more could you 
  want?
