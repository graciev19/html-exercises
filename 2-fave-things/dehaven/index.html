    <ul>
<li><strong>Pokemon</strong></li>
<p>I've been in love with these games for as long as I can remember. Though
  the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/">new games</a> have their flaws 
  (being too easy, having questionable new designs, not enough <em>banging</em> music,) 
  I love the series too much to complain. You get to collect a bunch of animal friends 
  and make them fight each other. What more could you want?

 <li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>
 <p>This is a game I recommend to everyone regardless of previous gaming experience. 
   You could have 10,000 hours on GTA or have never touched a console since your Nintendo 
   DS and I would still recommend trying this game. There's combat with underground monsters, 
   romancing options, and, most importantly, a fishing mini game.
