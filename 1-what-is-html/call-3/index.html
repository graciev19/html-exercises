        <h1>How to make a PB&J</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) is a staple food in the United States. Although peanut butter became a phenomenon in 1893 at the World’s Fair in Chicago, it was not until 1901 that the peanut butter and jelly sandwich was born. Julia Davis Chandler published the first sandwich recipe that combined peanut butter and jelly in the Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics. During World War II, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich rose to prominence as it appeared on soldiers’ ration menus due to the sandwich’s convenience and the accessibility of its ingredients. While variations of the iconic sandwich have emerged over time, the original peanut butter and jelly sandwich has remained an important part of the American diet.</p>
        <p>The rich peanut butter and the sweet jelly make the sandwich reliably delicious. However, it is also nutritious. The peanut butter provides protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. According to Harvard Health Medical Publishing, various studies have demonstrated that people who consume nuts or peanut butter decrease their chances of developing heart disease compared to those who do not. Many types of bread offer health benefits. Bread is composed of carbohydrates which are essential for fueling the body, specifically the brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system. Additionally, some bread, such as whole wheat, contains a decent amount of dietary fiber, which can reduce excessive hunger.</p>
        <p>Due to its deep roots in American history, convivence, and nutritional value, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is timeless. People all over the country grow up eating it. For some, it is what Mom and Dad made them for their school lunch every day. For others, it is the first meal that they learn to make on their own. At Happy Money, we believe that everyone should be able to experience such iconic food. Therefore, we have broken the process of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich down into easy and comprehensible steps.</p>
