        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting this weekend! I had <em>so</em> much fun playing in the snow. I'll never forget how you slipped and fell on your butt! Here's a list of the things I want to do next (from most to least).</p>

     <ol>
         <li>Go hiking.</li>
         <li>Go tubing on the lake.</li>
         <li>Go to the water park.</li>
         <li>Go to the state fair.</li>
         <li>Go to the new vegetarian restaurant in town.</li>
     </ol>

        I hope you're as excited to see me next time as I am excited to see you!

        <p>Love always,<br/>
        Kylie</p>
