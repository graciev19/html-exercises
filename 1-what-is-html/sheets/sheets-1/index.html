        <h2>Desserts!</h2>
        <h3><em>Raspberry Lemon Scones</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>3/5</strong></p>
        <p>I made these scones with my mom over winter break, when<br/>
        we were looking for a fun thing to eat with our tea (as aspiring<br/>
        Irish residents do. I wasn't a big fan of the lemon flavor, but<br/>
        these were overall a fun way to spice up teatime.</p>
        <h3><em>White Chocolate Chai Pumpkin Snickerdoodles</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>5/5</strong></p>
        <p>These are arguably the perfect cookies. Unless you're my<br/>
        brother who is allergic to chai spice. But seriously, I know<br/>
        you're judging the white chocolate. And I am a white chocolate fan.<br/>
        However, my friends who have been staunchly against white chocolate<br/>
        in the past LOVED these cookies. So ha!</p>

        <h2>Entrees!</h2>
        <h3><em>Pad Thai Spring Rolls</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>4/5</strong></p>
        <p>Another endeavour made with the help of my mom, since this<br/>
        one was a bit labor-intensive. Lots of chopping, shredding, noodle<br/>
        cooking, and wrapping involved. Not to mention the peanut sauce,<br/>
        which will make an appearance on this page below. But it was worth<br/>
        it for a fun spin on an old classic.</p>
        <h3><em>Asado Chicken Breast with Sauteed Lemon Zucchini</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>3/5</strong></p>
        <p>As a zucchini fan, I had such high hopes for this recipe! Note:<br/>
        I substituted chicken breast for chicken tenders because I have a deep-<br/>
        rooted fear of cooking meat unless it is in very small sizes. Anyway,<br/>
        something about cooking the zucchini in the leftover chicken goop irked<br/>
        me. And as with the scones, I'm not a big lemon fan.</p>

        <h2>Soups!</h2>
        <h3><em>Creamy Tuscan Garlic Tortellini Soup</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>4.5/5</strong></p>
        <p>The perfect winter soup. Perfect to make in huge quantities so you<br/>
        can eat it for the next five days. I went ham on this soup and kind of<br/>
        changed the recipe to whatever I wanted, adding mushrooms and chickpeas.<br/>
        It really made me feel like a chef and the whole experience was lovely.</p>

        <h2>Breakfast!</h2>
        <h3><em>Frozen Yogurt Covered Blueberries</em></h3>
        <p>Rating: <strong>3.5/5</strong></p>
        <p>If you can't enjoy just putting frozen blueberries into your cup<br/>
        of yogurt, this is the dish for you. Although delicious, I spent a ton<br/>
        of time covering blueberries in yogurt and letting them freeze on a tray.<br/>
        However, they were pretty delicious, so I might try this one again anyway.</p>
