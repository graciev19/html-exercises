        <h2>American Royals</h2>
        <p><em>and sequel Majesty</em></p>
        <h3>By Katharine McGee</h3>
        <p>These books were a total treat to read! They were soapy and dramatic and everything you need<br/>
        when you're going on one year into a pandemic. The premise: What if America had a royal family?<br/>
        Can't wait for the third book in the series to be released this year!</p>
        <br/>
        
        <h2>Fangirl, Vol. 1: The Mange</h2>
        <h3>By Sam Maggs & Rainbow Rowell</h3>
        <p>Fangirl is still one of my favorite books of all time, and Rainbow Rowell one of my favorite<br/>
        authors. It's just such a product of it's time-- a very nostalgic time for me now. I was so excited<br/>
        to learn that it was adapted into a manga series! I got to watch one of my favorite stories come<br/>
        to life! The art style is so fun, and it's a beautiful adaptation.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Being Lolita</h2>
        <h3>By Alisson Wood</h3>
        <p>I read this in one day. It was short and utterly devastating. This is a memoir by Wood about<br/>
        being groomed into a relationship with her high school English teacher, and how she survived.<br/>
        I was capitvated by Wood's every word; it's one you just can't put down.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>The Anthropocene Reviewed</h2>
        <h3>By John Green</h3>
        <p>John Green's debut work of creative nonfiction involved a series of essays rating seemingly<br/>
        random aspects of human life on earth. From Kentucky Bluegrass to Penguins of Madagascar to<br/>
        Halley's Comet, each essay is poignant, witty, and right on the nose of what it means to be<br/>
        human. John Green made me love the human race again.</p>

        <h2>People We Meet on Vacation</h2>
        <h3>By Emily Henry</h3>
        <p>I bought this book to read at the beach, and it was the best beach read I could have asked<br/>
        for! It's a really well-done, non-cheesy romance (not that I don't also love badly written<br/>
        cheesy romances). You'll fall in love with Alex and Poppy, and you're gonna get a really<br/>
        great urge to travel across the world as well.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Any Way the Wind Blows</h2>
        <h3>By Rainbow Rowell</h3>
        <p>What happens after the chosen one saves the world? Rainbow Rowell explores this in her Simon<br/>
        Snow series. The first in the series, <em>Carry On,</em> is my favorite book of all time, so to<br/>
        see this series finally come to a close was bittersweet, to say the least. This series explores<br/>
        mental health in a really honest way, and it doesn't hold back.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Normal People</h2>
        <h3>By Sally Rooney</h3>
        <p>This book was recommended to me by countless "booktokers" on TikTok, but as it turns out,<br/>
        TikTok was right. I finished this in two days in October and haven't stopped thinking about it<br/>
        since. It's a wonderful exploration of mental health and relationships through the vehicle of<br/>
        Connell and Marianne, two young adults who always seem to come back to each other throughout<br/>
        their comings of age.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Heartstopper</h2>
        <p><em>Volumes 1-4</em></p>
        <h3>By Alice Oseman</h3>
        <p>This one was read partially through library books and partially on Webtoon. It follows Nick<br/>
        and Charlie, two English teens who are navigating their relationship among the other troubles<br/>
        teenage life. I just love a story where it's the couple against the world. It's just nice to<br/>
        read something where you know the main characters' relationship is solid, and that's exactly<br>
        what Oseman does.</p>
