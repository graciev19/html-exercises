        <h1>I Bet You Think About Me (feat. Chris Stapleton)</h1>
        <h2><strong>Taylor Swift, </strong><em> Red (Taylor's Version)</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Such a fun and unique asset to the Red (Taylor's Version),<br/>
                I Bet You Think About Me leaves you reminiscing on Swift's twangy<br/>
                country origins and cursing the name of Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Love To Keep Me Warm</h1>
        <h2><strong>dodie, Laufey, </strong><em> Love To Keep Me Warm</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Still lingering in my mind from Christmas, this new release from<br/>
                Youtube star-turned indie artist dodie and Icelandic-Chinese TikTok<br/>
                star Laufey feels like the newest Christmas classic to me.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>cowboy like me</h1>
        <h2><strong>Taylor Swift, </strong><em> evermore</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One of Swift's more genius pieces of music, lyrically speaking.<br/>
                The artistry in cowboy like me is evidence of Swift's growth as an artist.<br/>
                This one's perfect to add to your "Westworld vibes" playlist.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>It's Called: Freefall</h1>
        <h2><strong>Rainbow Kitten Surprise, </strong><em> How To: Friend, Love, Freefall</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, I heard this one on TikTok first. However, this song will make you<br/>
                feel like the good guy who's just decided to become the villain. But like,<br/>
                in a cool, subtle way.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>A Burning Hill</h1>
        <h2><strong>Mitski, </strong><em> Puberty 2</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Just devastating. Mitski really knows how to pack a punch in a song that's<br/>
                only one minute and fifty seconds long. It's simplistic, but the imagery<br/>
                is just stunning. Don't listen to this one on a bad day.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Mushaboom</h1>
        <h2><strong>Feist, </strong><em> Let It Die</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Just great vibes. Listen to this and then try and tell me you weren't<br/>
                tapping your foot or bobbing your head. This song came to me when<br/>
                exploring friends' playlists, and it hasn't let me down since.<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Death With Dignity</h1>
        <h2><strong>Sufjan Stevens, </strong><em> Carrie & Lowell</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stevens has done it again. Transpoerted me to an alternate universe<br/>
                where fairies are real and I can walk around in the forest all day<br/>
                collecting pretty rocks. Also, can you say devastating lyrics? Mitski<br/>
                has some competition here.<br/>
            </li>
