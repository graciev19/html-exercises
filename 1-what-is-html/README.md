# 1-what-is-html

In class, follow along with me to learn some basic skills:

- Set up a Github repo, using Github Desktop &amp; VS Code
- VS Code tips when writing HTML

Repeat this process 3 times by adding an incremental number to your folder's last name. So, after my first folder named `lindgren`, which has an `index.html` file in it, I would create the followig 3  folders in the root folder, `1-what-is-html`, as follows:

- `lindgren-1`
- `lindgren-2`
- `lindgren-3`

**NOTE**: Mind your capitalization. We want all *lowercase* and *no spaces* for our project folders. Use hyphens `-` to separate keywords.

In each folder, create a new `index.html` file. Inside this new file, practice creating a basic page with block and inline elements based on the readings. The point is repetition, so do not copy-paste code. Instead, practice using your code editor's features to properly structure/indent your code.

Consider this example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Level 1 Heading nested inside as a child of header</h1>
  </header>
</body>
</html>
```

Note the nested parent-child relationships denoted by the 2-space indentation scheme.
