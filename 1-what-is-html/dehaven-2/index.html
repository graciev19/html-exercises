        <h1>I used to hate working out. Now, I schedule my classes around my gym time.</h1>
        <p>Finding time to work out is hard. Finding the energy to work out is hard. 
            McComas group exercise has given me a way to stay motivated and fit in a hectic 
            post-pandemic world. 
        </p>
        <p>In case you care to join me, here's my average workout schedule for the Spring 2022 semester.</p>


<h2>Bodypump</h2>>
<p>I do Bodypump45 (or the full hour, depending on my energy level,) on these days:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Wednesday's at 4:00</li>
<li>Friday's at 3:30</li>
<li>Saturday's at 11:00</li>
<li>Sunday's at 12:30</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cycle</h2>
    <p>I do Cycle for 45 minutes on these days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday's at 5:15</li>
<li>Tuesday's at 5:15</li>
<li>Thursday's at 5:15</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Workouts</h2>
<p>Sometimes, my schedule doesn't permit me to go to the classes that I want to. Life happens. 
    It's not ideal, but it's realistic. On those days, I'll ususally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run on the treadmill for 2.5-3 miles</li>
<li>Bike for 15-18 miles</li>
<li>Weightlift (and hope no man tries to correct my form)</li>
</ul>
