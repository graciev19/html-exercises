<body> <p> <h1>With the trade deadline approaching, The Dallas Mavericks have been very active in trade talks recently.</p></h1>
    <p> Names that have reportedly been mentioned in the front office are:
    <li> Myles Turner</li>
    <blockquote> Myles Turner is everything Dallas needs right now. He is an athletic big that can stretch the floor and an elite shotblocker. The Mavs currently have one of the best defenses in the entire 
        NBA, Turner can put Dallas where they need to be in terms of playoff position. The only issue is that he is searching for a role where he can provide to an offense more. This might interfere
        with Kristaps Porzingis' and Luka Doncic's roles in the current Dallas offense.</blockquote>
    <li> Jerami Grant</li>
    <blockquote> Jerami Grant would fit perfectly in Dallas' offensive system. He is an excellent three-point scorer and excels in defense on the wing. His size and skill-set would be a huge contribution to 
        the Dallas Mavericks roster. With that being said, the asking price is high for Grant as the Pistons are in a full rebuild mode and are searching for young assets and draft picks. </blockquote>
    <li> John Collins</li>
    <blockquote> John Collins is an insanely athletic that has the capabilities of shooting at the 3-pt line or taking you to the basket. His energy and offensive produciton are huge and would provide value to
        the Mavericks instantly; however, John Collins has an issue with his current role in Atlanta and wants to be a bigger part of an organization. Acquiring Collins would be a gamble as a backcourt of him 
        and Kristaps Porzingis would be a defensive risk. </blockquote>
    <li> Marcus Smart</li>
    <blockquote> Marcus Smart is one of the best defensive guards in the league. Dallas still may be looking to add another ballhandler to their repertoire, and adding Marcus Smart to the squad would relieve Luka
        of some of his playmaking abilities. One issue with Marcus Smart, though, is that he has shot very inneficiently this season. </blockquote>
    
    <P> It is clear that Dallas needs to make a move. After losing Tim Hardaway Jr. last night to a foot injury, the Mavericks are now in dire need of a bench scorer.   </P>
