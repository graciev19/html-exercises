    <h1>Adi Sircar's Fried Rice Formula</h1>
    <p>Fried rice is affordable, incredibly versatile, and easy to make.</p>
    <h2>Meat + egg + vegetable + spice + color + fragrance + flavor +
       garnishing + rice </h2>
    <p>I typically use beef, pork, chicken, shrimp,
       or mixed seafood. Currently, my favorite vegetables
      are mushrooms and asparagus. I add a couple spoonfuls
       of Lao Gan Ma's hot chili oil. I get a rich color from
      soy sauce. I use green onions for garnishing and fragrance. 
      The rice I use is leftover rice from the day before. </p>
    <p>I arrange all my ingredients in an organized fashion. Mise
       en place is critical for safety, accessibility, and great
        cooking. I always keep raw meats isolated, and I work
        from left to right. I always keep a clean kitchen. <strong>Never
          trust a dirty chef!</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>My Spices and Seasonings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Himalayan Salt</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
      <li>Red Pepper</li>
      <li>Onion Power</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>MSG</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fried Rice Philosophy</h2>
    <p>What is fried rice? Fried rice can be explained by observing
       a spoonful of it. What colors do you <strong>see</strong>? How does it
       <strong> smell</strong>? How does it <strong>feel</strong> in your mouth?
        Is there harmony?
    </p>
    <p>Each grain of rice needs color - <em>no whites allowed!</em> Each spoonful of
       fried rice needs at least four different colors. Meat must be sliced evenly 
        and vegetables must be diced evenly.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When I cook fried rice, I use <strong>The Path of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. </strong>Earth
       is the meat and vegetables, Moon is the rice, and Sun is the egg.

    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Earth</li>
      <p>Earth is the meat and vegetables. I add these first. The order
         matters - <em>different meats and vegetables have different
            cook times. I add some seasonings and spices at this point.</em></p>
      <li>Moon</li>
      <p>Moon is the rice. I use leftover rice. I break apart the clumps in my wok,
        add soy sauce, hot chili oil, and other seasonings of choice. </p>
      <li>Sun</li>
      <p>I add the egg last.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>After I plate the fried rice, I top it with finely chopped green onions, and serve.</p>
