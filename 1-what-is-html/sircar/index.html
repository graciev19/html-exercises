    <h1>Adi Sircar's Fried Rice Formula</h1>
      <p>Fried rice is affordable, incredibly versatile, and easy to make.</p>
    <h2>Meat + egg + vegetable + spice + color + fragrance + flavor + garnishing + rice </h2>
      <p>I typically use beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, or mixed seafood. Currently, my favorite vegetables 
        are mushrooms and asparagus. I add a couple spoonfuls of Lao Gan Ma's hot chili oil. I get a rich
         color from soy sauce. I use green onions for garnishing and fragrance. I use leftover rice from yesterday. 
      </p>
      <p>I arrange all my ingredients in an organized fashion. Mise en place is critical for safety, accessibility,
         and great cooking. I always keep raw meats isolated, and I work from left to right. I always keep a clean kitchen.
          <strong>Never trust a dirty chef!</strong>
      </p>
    <h2>My Spices and Seasonings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Himalayan Salt</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
      <li>Red Pepper</li>
      <li>Onion Power</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>MSG</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fried Rice Philosophy</h2>
    <p>What is fried rice? Fried rice can be explained by observing a spoonful of it. What colors do you <strong>see</strong>?
       How does it<strong> smell</strong>? How does it <strong>feel</strong> in your mouth? Is there harmony?
    </p>
    <p>Each grain of rice needs color - <em>no whites allowed!</em> Each spoonful of fried rice needs at least four different colors.
       Meat must be sliced thinly and vegetables must be diced evenly.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>When I cook fried rice, I use <strong>The Path of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. </strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Earth</li>
      <p>The meat and vegetables are the Earth. I add these first. The order matters - <em>different meats and vegetables have different 
        cook times.</em> I add some seasonings and spices at this point.
      </p>
      <li>Moon</li>
      <p>The rice is the Moon. I use leftover rice. I break apart the clumps in my wok, add soy sauce, hot chili oil, and other seasonings of choice.</p>
      <li>Sun</li>
      <p>The egg is the Sun. I add the eggs last.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>After I plate the fried rice, I top it with finely chopped green onions, and serve.</p>
