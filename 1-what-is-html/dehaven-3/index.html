        <h1>I've played guitar for six years. Here's some songs I never want to hear again.</h1>
        <p>I've played open mics, local festivals, even a bizzarre gig in a coffee shop 
            the size of an atrium. More often then not, I played classic rock, mostly because it was 
            unoffensive and highly demanded by middle aged white people. Throughout my experience, the 
        following songs brought me the most pain.</p>
        
        <ul>
<li>"Sweet Child O' Mine"</li>
<p>This is the only GnR song people know, and if I hear the riff without warning I may 
    burst into tears. I like GnR just fine, but this song is way too overplayed. 
</p>
<li>"Smoke on the Water"</li>
<p>I love Deep Purple. I highly recommend <em>Machine Head</em> for whoever wants to get into 
    the world of heavy metal. This song doesn't do the band justice in the least.</p>
<li>Stairway to Heaven</li>
<p>This song is good, but it's so oversaturated that I can't enjoy it anymore. Same goes with 
    virtually all Zeppelin songs. </p>
<li>"Sympathy for the Devil"</li>
<p>This one is personal. I despise the Rolling Stones with a passion. Their vanity and problematic 
    songs don't make up for any musicianship they might have. I mean, they labeled themselves 
    the "Greatest Rock Band" while the Beatles were still together. Their heads are very far up their 
    own butts and I think more people should call them out for it. </p>
        </ul>
<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
        <p>Classic rock is by no means bad. There's plenty of really cool stuff buried beneath the 
            overplayed Top 40 hits.</p>
