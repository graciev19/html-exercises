        <title>My Biased Ranking of the Star Wars films</title>>

        <h1>Star Wars fans are impossible to please. I'd know, I'm one of them.</h1>
        <p>Everybody's entitled to their own opinions. I'm also entitled to judge those opinions with no remorse. I usually keep to myself, but when I see that someone that unironically thinks <em>The Phantom Menace</em> is a masterpiece, then I can't hold my silence.</p>

        <p>Here's my entirely biased ranking of the nine Star Wars movies.</p>

        <ol>
<li><em>Empire Strikes Back</em></li>
<li><em>A New Hope</em></li>
<li><em>The Force Awakens</em></li>
<li><em>Return of the Jedi</em></li>
<li><em>The Last Jedi</em></li>
<li><em>Revenge of the Sith</em></li>
<li><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></li>
<li><em>Attack of the Clones</em></li>
<li><em>The Phantom Menace</em></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Admittedly, the bottom three films were difficult to rank. They all have their own problems, but if I <em>had</em> to watch one, it would be <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>.</p>
