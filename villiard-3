   <p> What happened you may ask> </p>
   <li> On December 28, my roommate returned to our apartment and the entire unit was flooded. </li>
   <li> The water heater belonging in the unit above us bursted, causing water to flood our apartment, cracking our ceiling and ruining our walls. </li>
   <li> The leasing office failed to act quickly enough in repairing the damage, which caused mold to grow on the items that were wet. </li>
   <li> Because we had left our bedroom doors open when we left Blacksburg to have Christmas with our families, all of our clothes and everything in our rooms were ruined. </li>
   <p> We are currently in the middle of processing a claim, so hopefully we can get our money back for our stuff and soon have a place to live. </p>
