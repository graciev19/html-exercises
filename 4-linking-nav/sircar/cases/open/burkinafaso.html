          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        </header>
        <p>President Roch Kaboré was overthrown in a military coup in January 2022 due to his failure to curtail a long-running jihadist insurgency. Mass protests calling for his resignation and a foiled coup plot took place in the weeks leading up to his overthrow. Coup leader Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba said constitutional order would be restored “when the conditions are right”, and urged support from international partners. Nevertheless, ECOWAS suspended Burkina Faso from the regional bloc, but, for now, stopped short of more-punitive measures. Rallies in support of the military takeover are likely to continue and will probably be combined with pro-Russian and anti-French slogans, posing risks of property damage to French assets and criminal attacks targeting French citizens. Damiba has said combating terrorism is the first priority, but jihadist groups are likely to benefit from instability in the country and the wider Sahel to mount further attacks towards their goal of reaching coastal West Africa. The risk of attack and ambush of companies involved in gold mining and cotton production is likely to increase in a bid to destroy major sources of income. The arrival of Russian Wagner private military contractors in neighbouring Mali increases the likelihood of their deployment in Burkina Faso, particularly if they are perceived to be effective against jihadist groups. The risk to foreign travellers remains high following the abduction and killing of three Westerners near the Arli nature reserve in April 2021. With a focus on security, the military authorities are unlikely to introduce major changes in sectors such as mining, infrastructure, and utility projects. Any expanded investment spending as planned by the previous government is unlikely in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased military expenditure. The economy continues to be highly susceptible to external shocks, especially to volatile global price trends in cotton and gold. Although gold prices have remained above historical averages, any significant decline would dampen foreign-exchange earnings from the sector. Foreign investment in what represents Africa's fourth-largest gold mining industry is likely to be deterred by the recent coup and the increase in terrorism and security risks.
